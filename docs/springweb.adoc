=== What is Quarkus?

image::logo.png[quarkus-logo, 900]

Quarkus is a Kubernetes Native Java stack tailored for GraalVM & OpenJDK HotSpot, crafted from the best of breed Java libraries and standards. Amazingly fast boot time, incredibly low RSS memory (not just heap size!) offering near instant scale up and high density memory utilization in container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes. Quarkus uses a technique called https://quarkus.io/vision/container-first[compile time boot^] and offers a unified imperative and reactive programming model and a number of other developer features like Live Reload to bring _real joy_ to your development.

*Red Hat* offers the fully supported https://access.redhat.com/products/quarkus[Red Hat Build of Quarkus(RHBQ)^] with support and maintenance of Quarkus. In this workhop, you will use Quarkus to develop Kubernetes-native microservices and deploy them to OpenShift. Quarkus is one of the runtimes included in https://www.redhat.com/en/products/runtimes[Red Hat Runtimes^]. https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_build_of_quarkus[Learn more about RHBQ^].

Throughout this lab you'll discover how Quarkus can make your development of cloud native apps faster and more productive.

=== Add Qute extentions to Quarkus PetClinic Project

*Qute* is a templating engine designed specifically to meet the Quarkus needs. The usage of reflection is minimized to reduce the size of native images. The API combines both the imperative and non-blocking reactive style of coding. In the development mode, all files located in *src/main/resources/templates* are watched for changes and modifications are immediately visible. In this lab, you will learn how to easily render templates from the *Spring MVC* web application to the *Quarkus* using Qute Templating engine.

Quarkus aims to provide a support for a full https://quarkus.io/extensions/[extension ecosystem^], to make it easy to discover and consume 3rd party extensions, as well as providing easier version management. So let's add *Qute extentions* here. Open a new terminal in CodeReady Workspaces, run the following command to add the _quarkus-qute_ and _quarkus-qute-resteasy_ extensions to your project:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
mvn -q quarkus:add-extension -Dextensions="quarkus-qute, quarkus-resteasy-qute" -f $CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT/quarkus-workshop-labs/quarkus-petclinic
----

You should see
[source,console]
----
✅ Extension io.quarkus:quarkus-resteasy-qute has been installed
✅ Extension io.quarkus:quarkus-qute has been installed
----

Let's go through how the Spring Petclinic application works.

== Login to OpenShift

Although your Eclipse Che workspace is running on the Kubernetes cluster, it's running with a default restricted _Service Account_ that prevents you from creating most resource types. So we'll log in with your workshop user. Click on **Login to OpenShift**, and enter your given credentials:

* Username: **`{{ USER_ID }}`**
* Password: **`{{ OPENSHIFT_USER_PASSWORD }}`**
