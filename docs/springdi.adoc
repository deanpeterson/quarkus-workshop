= Spring DI to Quarkus CDI
:experimental:



Spring IoC container caching which spares us unnecessary set up time between test execution.
Dependency Injection of test fixture instances, meaning that we don't need to perform application context lookups. See the use of @Autowired on the clinic instance variable, which uses autowiring by type. As an alternative, we could annotate clinic with JSR 250's @Resource to achieve dependency injection by name. (see: @ContextConfiguration, DependencyInjectionTestExecutionListener)
